# Description

Displays Index of Series Posts using `series-index` shortcode. This plugin is multi-site compatible and integrates with the [Toggle Show/Hide](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/toggle-showhide/) plugin from azurecurve. The shortcode can be used on posts and pages; the format of the index and other options are user configurable through an admin page.

Two custom fields (`Series` and `Series Position`) need to be added to each post in the series; these fields are used for selecting the posts and ordering them when the index is displayed; series index post should be Series Position of 0 (this is used for determining the link for the title).

Shortcode `[series-index]` is placed in the post where you want the index.

Shortcode `[series-index-link]` can be used in a post a link back to the series index (Series Position = 0) post using the series title as the link text; `[series-index-link]alternative text[/series-index-link]` to display text different to the series title. title attribute can be used to create link to other series index post; e.g. `[series-index-link title='Implementing Jet Reports' /]`.

This plugin is multisite compatible; each site will need settings to be configured in the admin dashboard.
